Here a few minimalistic coding rules for llvm2goto source tree:

-- Follow the coding standard mentioned here : https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc/blob/master/CODING_STANDARD

-- Also follow Google Styleguide mentioned here : https://github.com/google/styleguide

-- Especially, make sure the code goes through cpplint utility of google style guide.


Git usage
---------

-- DO NOT commit unrelated changes together
-- NEVER push to master branch. Let someone else do the code
review and merge.
-- ENSURE that your computer time is correct or it will mess
up the git history.
-- Open an issue for every TODO, assign it to yourself if
you are supposed to do the task
-- NEVER add or commit binary files or files that belong to
dependencies (e.g. CBMC codebase or LLVM codebase)
-- NEVER commit any file that can be generated through compilation etc.
